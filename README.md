# 🧠 Next Word Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts the **next word** in a sequence of text using a trained **LSTM Recurrent Neural Network**.  
It uses the **Gutenberg corpus** from NLTK as training data.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts next word given a sentence.
- Streamlit web interface for live prediction.
- LSTM-based deep learning model trained on literary text.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
