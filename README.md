# 🧠 Next Word Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts the **next word** in a sequence of text using a trained **LSTM Recurrent Neural Network**.  
It uses the **Gutenberg corpus** from NLTK as training data.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts next word given a sentence.
- Streamlit web interface for live prediction.
- LSTM-based deep learning model trained on literary text.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK
- Streamlit
- NumPy / Pandas

## ▶️ Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
🧮 How to Use

- Open the app in your browser via the link below.
- Enter a few words or a short sentence in the text box.
- Click “Predict Next Word” to see the most likely next word generated by the model.
